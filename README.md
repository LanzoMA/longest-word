# Longest Word

* This Python script calculates the longest possible word that can only contain specific characters.
* I have added the letters that are only possible to represent on two types CASIO calculators (as letters_1 and letters_2).

* To run this, in a terminal enter these commands one by one:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/LanzoMA/longest_word.git
cd longest_word/
./venv/bin/python main.py
```
